The Caesar Cipher is a foundational cryptographic algorithm that shifts each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 
This implementation provides a professional-grade tool for both encryption and decryption, illustrating a core concept in symmetric-key cryptography.

Documentation
Purpose: To provide a reliable, modular, and easy-to-use tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher.

Dependencies: Standard Python libraries. No external packages are required.

Functionality: The caesar_cipher function processes a given string by iterating through each character. 
It identifies uppercase and lowercase letters and applies a modular shift operation. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. 
The main function offers a command-line interface, handling user input, performing error checking for shift values, and providing clear output.
